                Iran (Persian: ایران‎ Irān [ʔiːˈɾɒːn] (About this soundlisten)), also called Persia,[10] and
                officially
                the Islamic Republic of Iran (Persian: جمهوری اسلامی ایران‎ Jomhuri-ye Eslāmi-ye Irān (About this
                soundlisten) [dʒomhuːˌɾije eslɒːˌmije ʔiːˈɾɒn]), is a country in Western Asia.[11][12] It is
                bordered to
                the northwest by Armenia and Azerbaijan,[a] to the north by the Caspian Sea, to the northeast by
                Turkmenistan, to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan, to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf
                of
                Oman, and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Its central location in Eurasia and proximity to the
                Strait of
                Hormuz give it significant geostrategic importance.[13] Tehran is the capital and largest city, as
                well
                as the leading economic and cultural hub; it is also the most populous city in Western Asia, with
                more
                than 8.8 million residents, and up to 15 million including the metropolitan area.[14] With 83
                million
                inhabitants,[6] Iran is the world's 17th most populous country.[15] Spanning 1,648,195 km2 (636,372
                sq
                mi), it is the second largest country in the Middle East and the 17th largest in the world.

                Iran is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations,[16][17] beginning with the formation of the
                Elamite kingdoms in the fourth millennium BC. It was first unified by the Iranian Medes in the
                seventh
                century BC,[18] and reached its territorial height in the sixth century BC, when Cyrus the Great
                founded
                the Achaemenid Empire, which stretched from Eastern Europe to the Indus Valley, making it one of the
                largest empires in history.[19] The empire fell to Alexander the Great in the fourth century BC and
                was
                divided into several Hellenistic states. An Iranian rebellion established the Parthian Empire in the
                third century BC, which was succeeded in the third century AD by the Sasanian Empire, a major world
                power for the next four centuries.[20][21]

                Arab Muslims conquered the empire in the seventh century AD, and the subsequent Islamization of Iran
                led
                to the decline of the once dominant Zoroastrian religion. Iran subsequently became a major center of
                Islamic culture and learning, with its art, literature, philosophy, and architecture spreading
                across
                the Muslim world and beyond during the Islamic Golden Age. Over the next two centuries, a series of
                native Muslim dynasties emerged before the Seljuq Turks and the Ilkhanate Mongols conquered the
                region.
                In the 15th century, the native Safavids reestablished a unified Iranian state and national
                identity,[4]
                with the country's conversion to Shia Islam marking a turning point in Iranian and Muslim
                history.[5][22]

                Under the reign of Nader Shah in the 18th century, Iran once again became a major world power,[23]
                though by the 19th century a series of conflicts with the Russian Empire led to significant
                territorial
                losses.[24][25] However, Iran would remain one of the few non-European states to avoid colonization
                by
                Europe. The early 20th century saw the Persian Constitutional Revolution, which created the
                country's
                first constitutional monarchy and legislature, and a gradual move towards greater democracy. Efforts
                to
                nationalize its fossil fuel supply from Western companies led to an Anglo-American coup in 1953,
                which
                resulted in greater autocratic rule under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and growing Western political
                influence.[26] He went on to launch a far-reaching series of reforms in 1963, which included
                industrial
                growth, infrastructure expansion, land reforms, and increased women's rights.[27] However,
                widespread
                dissatisfaction with the monarchy culminated in the Iranian Revolution, which established the
                current
                Islamic Republic in 1979.[28] Iran was invaded by Iraq in 1980, leading to a bloody and protracted
                war
                that lasted for almost eight years, and ended in a stalemate with devastating losses for both sides.

                Iran's political system combines elements of a presidential democracy and an Islamic theocracy, with
                the
                ultimate authority vested in an autocratic "Supreme Leader".[29] The Iranian government is widely
                considered to be authoritarian, and has attracted widespread criticism for its significant
                constraints
                and abuses against human rights and civil liberties,[30][31][32][33] including the violent
                suppression
                of mass protests, unfair elections, and unequal rights for women and children. It has also been
                alleged
                by international observors to sponsor and spread antisemitism both domestically and
                internationally.[34][35][36]

                Iran is a founding member of the UN, ECO, OIC, and OPEC. It is a major regional and middle
                power,[37][38] and its large reserves of fossil fuels — including the world's largest natural gas
                supply
                and the third largest proven oil reserves[39] — exert considerable influence in international energy
                security and the world economy.[40][3] The country's rich cultural legacy is reflected in part by
                its 22
                UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the third largest number in Asia and 10th largest in the world.[41]
                Historically a multi-ethnic country, Iran remains a pluralistic society comprising numerous ethnic,
                linguistic, and religious groups, the largest being Persians, Azeris, Kurds, Mazandaranis and
                Lurs.[3]
